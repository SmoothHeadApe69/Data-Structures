# Data-Structures
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely,a data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively. Selecting the correct data structure to solve a problem in computer science is very important, since it can affect the efficiency of the algorithm at hand.

This repository will demonstrate the core data structures that are essential in computer science to solve most problems, from the basic ones like arrays to more advanced one like Doubly Linked Lists.
